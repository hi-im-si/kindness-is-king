        The Kindness is King print is letterpress printed onto 270gsm turquoise
        Colourplan by G.F Smith, using moveable wood and metal type. Each print
        was hand-fed into the press multiple times to underpin the design with
        white for maximum vibrancy of the colours. Blue and pink were then
        applied directly to the inking system to create a gradated colour, (a
        process called split fountain). The charm of this type of colour
        printing means no two prints are ever exactly the same.
